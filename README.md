# Block Breaker Game
Made with Unity

*Has a win screen, game over, and Lives counter. Only one level right now. Based on the Unity Breakout tutorial from 2015, but **using coroutines instead of invokes**.*

**The experience**: I am currently learning the Unity engine, and making small game clones is a good way to start. I also wanted to challenge myself by updating the project, using coroutines instead of invokes. I needed more practice with coroutines, and this was a good exercise. It was also a good way to practice Unity UI, which I wasn't very familiar with.
